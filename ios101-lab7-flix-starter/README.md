## Lab 6: Flix Detail

### Overview

In this lab, you'll allow users to save their favorite movies and view them in a "favorites" list on a separate tab. To do this, you'll leverage *User Defaults* to save and retrieve movies from your app's local storage. Adding a tab bar to your app will be done using a *Tab Bar Controller*.
